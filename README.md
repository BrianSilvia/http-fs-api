# http-fs-api
> A generalized RESTful API for managing a remote file system.

# Overview

This API is intended to be the standard for communication between the client and server to manage the filesystem component of the Brinkbit IDE. While our use case is specific, we hope to eventually develop this as a generalized implementation-agnostic standard for managing remote file systems via HTTP requests.

The http-fs-api follows the [RESTful API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) systems architecture style. [GraphQL](https://github.com/facebook/graphql) seems to be very promising as a query standard for managing client-server relationships and may possibly lead to the deprecation of this standard at a future time.
