# Overview

This API is intended to be the standard for communication between the client and server for the filesystem component of the Brinkbit IDE.
While our use case is specific, we hope to develop this as a generalized implementation-agnostic standard for managing remote file systems via HTTP requests.

The http-fs-api follows the [RESTful API](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm) systems architecture style.
What this means in practice is that all actions are mapped to four [HTTP methods](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html) (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) which in turn represent the four [CRUD commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
The requested url contains a uri component which determines what resource will be manipulated.

While the API is designed to handle paths, directories, and files as though the backend were an actual file system, it's important to note that your backend implementation does not need to be an actual filesystem.
In fact, we recommend that you not store the manipulated resources on an actual filesystem but use some other form of data storage i.e. a database or S3 Buckets.

All examples contained in this document are written as HTTP requests, with the fictitious `http://animals.com` as the domain.
The structure of the file system is as follows:

TODO: replace with graphic.

+ animals/
  + cats/
    + siamese.jpg
    + cat_adjectives.txt
    + kindof_pretty_cat.png
    + very_pretty_cat.gif
    + more_pretty_cats/
  + dogs/
    + golden_retriever.bmp
    + loyal_companion.png

# Resources

Our filesystem has two types of resources, files and directories.
Both can be manipulated with the same actions, but each behave a little differently.

TODO: expand explanation

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

# Request

Requests are made on a uri with one of the following four [HTTP methods](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html): "GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE".

A uri represents the resource to take action on.
For example the uri `/cats/siamese.jpg`

A JSON object MUST be at the root of every JSON API request containing data.
This object defines a document's "top level".
Every request containing a JSON object MUST have a `data` field at the top level.

A request MAY specify an `action` field within the `data` field, and it MAY have an associated `parameters` field. If no action is specified, then the associated default behavior occurs. Each `action` field has a set of accepted parameters, and the API MUST return a 400 status if a mismatch occurs.
Note that each method's default has it's own alias, for consistency.

Following our example file system, to move the `siamese.jpg` resource from the `/cats/` directory to the `/dogs/` directory, you would send the following request:

```http
PUT /cats/siamese.jpg HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/fs.api+json
Accept: application/fs.api+json

{
  "data": {
    "action": "Move",
    "parameters": {
      "destination": "/dogs/"
    }
  }
}
```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

# Response

Similar to the request syntax, every response WILL have a JSON object at the root of the response when it contains data, which defines the response's "top level".
The only exceptions to this are the `read` and `download` GET requests, which contain ONLY the resource's data.
Every other response MUST have a `data` field at the top level on success, or an `errors` field on failure, but NEVER both.
There is an optional `metadata` field that would contain relevant or more descriptive data.

An error response contains an array of at least one error object, and will take the following format:

```javascript
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "status": 404,
      "message": "File not found."
    }
  ]
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Actions

`Action` is an optional parameter under `data` which gives direction for what operation will take place on the specified resource, or set of resources.
Each action has an associated [HTTP method](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html), and only the actions associated with that HTTP method are accepted.
If a mismatch between HTTP method and action occurs, the API MUST return a 400 status.
The list of actions per method are as follows:

GET: [`Read`](#1.1), [`Help`](#1.2), [`Search`](#1.3), [`Inspect`](#1.4), [`Download`](#1.5)

POST: [`Create`](#2.1), [`Bulkupload`](#2.2), [`Copy`](#2.3)

PUT: [`Update`](#3.1), [`Move`](#3.2), [`Rename`](#3.3)

DELETE: [`Delete`](#4.1)
